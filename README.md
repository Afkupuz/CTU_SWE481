Class group project for CTU capstone class

Assignment

For the group project deliverable, create a software development plan (8–10 pages) incorporating the collective work from the individual project assignments submitted by the team members. The software development plan should contain the content listed below, and it should conform to the same requirements as the individual project weekly assignments.  
  
In addition to the software development plan document, your team should prepare a PowerPoint presentation of 10–15 slides that summarizes the contents and highlights of the software development plan. The presentation should be usable as the basis for a presentation that might be given to the stakeholders of a project to gain final approval for moving forward with the project into the development stage.
